### Hello there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is George Pantazes.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a fullstack automated testing system at work, and various side projects in my spare time such as browser extensions or game demos and prototypes.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning frontend development with React, backend development with Spring, and fullstack development in general.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects that coordinate real action between people, such as apps that coordinate volutneering opportunities or organize trash pickup.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with growing as a community-driven engineer and participating member of the open source community. In other words: Let's be dev friends!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about automated testing with Selenium.
